# Next Steps for Implementing the Centralized Type System

## Current Status

We have created the following centralized type definition files:

1. `CameraTypes.swift`: Contains camera-related type definitions
2. `AllergenTypes.swift`: Contains allergen-related type definitions
3. `ScanTypes.swift`: Contains scan-related type definitions
4. `SharedTypes.swift`: Documentation for the type system

However, there are still issues with the module structure that prevent proper importing of these types. As a temporary solution, some files contain duplicate type definitions with TODO comments indicating that they should be imported from the centralized type files in the future.

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Module Structure

The first step is to fix the module structure to allow proper importing of types. This may involve:

- Ensuring all type files are included in the correct target
- Checking build phases to ensure files are compiled in the correct order
- Verifying that the module name is consistent across the project

### 2. Update Import Statements

Once the module structure is fixed, update all files to import types from the centralized type files:

- Remove duplicate type definitions
- Add appropriate import statements
- Update any references to the types

### 3. Consolidate Other Type Definitions

Identify any other type definitions that are used across multiple files and consolidate them into appropriate centralized type files:

- UI-related types
- Networking types
- Utility types

### 4. Ensure Consistent Access Modifiers

Review all type definitions to ensure they have appropriate access modifiers:

- `public` for types that need to be accessed from other modules
- `internal` (default) for types that only need to be accessed within the same module
- `private` or `fileprivate` for types that should be restricted to a specific scope

### 5. Update Entry Point

Update the main entry point of the application to use the centralized types:

- Remove temporary type definitions
- Add appropriate import statements
- Update any references to the types

### 6. Test Thoroughly

After making these changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure everything works as expected:

- Build and run the application
- Test all features that use the centralized types
- Verify that there are no duplicate type definitions
- Check for any compiler warnings or errors

## Recommendations

### Use Relative Imports

When importing types from other files within the same module, use relative imports:

```swift
// Instead of
import AllerGuard

// Use
import Foundation
import SwiftUI
// No need for special import for types in the same module
```

### Consider Swift Packages

For more complex module structures, consider using Swift packages to organize your code:

- Create a package for each major component
- Define clear interfaces between packages
- Use explicit imports to access types from other packages

### Implement Proper Dependency Injection

Use dependency injection to make your code more testable and maintainable:

- Define protocols for services
- Inject dependencies through initializers
- Use a service registry to manage dependencies

### Document Import Strategy

Document your import strategy to help other developers understand how to use the centralized types:

- Add comments to files explaining where types are defined
- Create a README.md file (like this one) to document the overall strategy
- Update documentation when making changes to the type system
