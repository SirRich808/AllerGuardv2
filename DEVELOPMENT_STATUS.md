# Development Status

*Last Updated: March 14, 2025*

## Current Session Status
- **Feature**: Core Services Implementation & MVVM Architecture Setup
- **Status**: Implementation In Progress - Addressing Import & Structure Issues
- **Last Completed**:
  - Created CameraTypes.swift to centralize camera-related type definitions
  - Updated CameraService.swift to import types from CameraTypes.swift
  - Updated ServiceProtocols.swift to import types from CameraTypes.swift
  - Updated AppTypes.swift to import types from CameraTypes.swift
  - Added makePreviewLayer method to CameraService implementation
  - Added proper import statements in AllerGuardApp.swift for platform-specific dependencies
  - Added TODO comments to indicate where duplicate types should be replaced with imports
  - Fixed AllergenService.swift by removing protocol conformance to resolve "Cannot find type 'AllergenServiceProtocol'" error
  - Removed @main attribute from AllerGuardApp.swift to address "'main' attribute cannot be used in a module that contains top-level code" error
  - Created AppTypes.swift to centralize shared type definitions
  - Created ServiceProtocols.swift with comprehensive protocol definitions for all services
  - Created new entry point files (Main.swift and AllerGuardEntryPoint.swift) to resolve @main attribute issues
  - Created comprehensive service protocols (CameraServiceProtocol, OCRServiceProtocol, AllergenServiceProtocol, StorageServiceProtocol, PermissionServiceProtocol)
  - Implemented stub service implementations (OCRService, AllergenService, StorageService, PermissionService)
  - Created basic app structure with MainView and TabView navigation
  - Implemented CameraView UI with placeholder components
  - Set up AppState for global state management
  - Created models for allergens, user profiles, and scan results
  - Established new Module Structure and Import Management Rule [P0] to address persistent import issues

## Current Challenges
- **Import Resolution**: Working on proper imports between files to resolve "Cannot find type" errors
  - Created CameraTypes.swift but still need to properly import it across the codebase
  - Need to resolve module import issues (e.g., "No such module 'CameraTypes'")
- **Duplicate Type Definitions**: Making progress on consolidating duplicate type definitions
  - Camera types now centralized in CameraTypes.swift
  - Still need to address duplicate allergen-related types
- **Protocol Conformance**: Need to ensure all services properly implement their protocols
  - Added makePreviewLayer to CameraService to match protocol requirements
  - Need to address AllergenMatch Codable conformance issue
- **Entry Point Resolution**: Need to finalize a single entry point for the application

## Next Steps
1. **Finalize Module Structure**:
   - Choose a single entry point file (either Main.swift or AllerGuardEntryPoint.swift)
   - Delete redundant entry point files
   - Update imports across the codebase to reference the centralized type definitions
   - Resolve the "No such module" errors by using proper import statements

2. **Consolidate Type Definitions**:
   - Continue centralizing shared types in AppTypes.swift or ServiceProtocols.swift
   - Update AllergenMatch to conform to Codable protocol
   - Remove remaining duplicate definitions from individual service files
   - Update references to use the centralized types

3. **Update Service Implementations**:
   - Ensure all services properly implement their protocols
   - Complete the implementation of service methods beyond stubs
   - Establish proper dependency injection between services

4. **Complete Feature Implementation**:
   - Complete the CameraViewModel implementation
   - Connect the CameraView to the CameraService
   - Implement the remaining views (HistoryView, ProfileView, SettingsView)
   - Implement proper OCR processing with Vision framework
   - Connect OCR results to allergen detection
   - Implement Core Data for persistent storage

## Implementation Progress
### Core Architecture & Development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MVVM Architecture Rule [P0]**: Structure implemented but facing import issues
- ‚úÖ **Code Organization Rule [P0]**: Code organized in Models, Views, ViewModels, Services folders
- üîÑ **Service Registration Rule [P0]**: Service protocols defined, registration partially implemented
- ‚úÖ **Swift Concurrency Rule [P1]**: Using async/await for asynchronous operations
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling Rule [P1]**: Proper error types with user-friendly messages
- üîÑ **UI Component Consistency Rule [P2]**: Basic implementation with TabView and navigation
- üîÑ **Type Centralization Rule [P0]**: Created CameraTypes.swift, working on proper imports

### Feature Implementation
- üîÑ **Camera Functionality**: UI implemented, service stub created, makePreviewLayer added
- üîÑ **OCR Implementation**: Service stub implemented, needs Vision framework integration
- üîÑ **Allergen Detection**: Service stub implemented, detection logic pending
- üîÑ **User Profiles**: Models defined, implementation pending
- üîÑ **Scan History**: Models defined, implementation pending
- üîÑ **UI Enhancements**: Basic TabView structure implemented

### Testing & Performance
- ‚è±Ô∏è **OCR Performance Benchmark Rule [P1]**: Not started
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Offline Functionality Rule [P1]**: Not started
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Edge Case Database Rule [P1]**: Not started

## Known Issues
- Multiple entry point files causing confusion (Main.swift, AllerGuardEntryPoint.swift, AppDelegate.swift)
- Import issues between files causing "Cannot find type" errors
- Module import errors (e.g., "No such module 'CameraTypes'")
- Duplicate type definitions across files (Allergen, SensitivityLevel, etc.)
- AllergenMatch needs to conform to Codable for proper serialization/deserialization
- Temporary duplicate definitions in AllerGuardApp.swift with TODO comments

## Notes for Next Session
Focus on resolving the import issues by using proper relative imports within the same module. Since CameraTypes.swift is in the same module as the rest of the code, we should use direct imports rather than module imports. Continue consolidating type definitions and removing duplicates, ensuring all services properly implement their protocols. Address the AllergenMatch Codable conformance issue to fix the linter errors in ServiceProtocols.swift. Once the basic structure is working, connect the services to their respective views through view models, following the MVVM architecture pattern. Implement proper error handling and ensure all UI updates happen on the main thread. Consider using a dependency injection container to manage service lifecycles and dependencies.
